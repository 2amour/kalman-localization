# kalman-localization
MATLAB implementation of localization using sensor fusion of GPS/INS/compass through an error-state Kalman filter.

The MATLAB code borrows heavily from Paul D. Groves' book, *Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems*, his code is marked as his, and is held under the BSD license.

PLEASE NOTE: I cannot provide my testing data as it was collected using a vehicle owned by General Motors. Please, refer to the comments in the initialization scripts for a description of the data format and you should be able to adapt your own data. Alternatively, the book comes with a CD-ROM that has his code (fully working filter) along with a system for generating test data.
